      <b>  Fuzzy Keyword Search </b>
        <br />
• As Cloud Computing becomes prevalent, more and more sensitive information are being

centralized into the cloud.
        <br />

• For the protection of data privacy, sensitive data usually have to be encrypted before

outsourcing, which makes effective data utilization a very challenging task. Although

traditional searchable encryption schemes allow a user to securely search over encrypted

data through keywords and selectively retrieve files of interest, these techniques support

only exact keyword search.<br />

• That is, there is no tolerance of minor typos and format inconsistencies which, on the

other hand, are typical user searching behavior and happen very frequently. This

significant drawback makes existing techniques unsuitable in Cloud Computing as it

greatly affects system usability, rendering user searching experiences very frustrating and

system efficacy very low. In this paper, for the first time we formalize and solve the

problem of effective fuzzy keyword search over encrypted cloud data while maintaining

keyword privacy. <br />

• Fuzzy keyword search greatly enhances system usability by returning the matching files

when users’ searching inputs exactly match the predefined keywords or the closest

possible matching files based on keyword similarity semantics, when exact match fails. <br />

• In our solution, we exploit edit distance to quantify keywords similarity and develop an

advanced technique on constructing fuzzy keyword sets, which greatly reduces the

storage and representation overheads. Through rigorous security analysis, we show that

our proposed solution is secure and privacy-preserving, while correctly realizing the goal

of fuzzy keyword search. <br />

        <b>BI SYSTEM PROJECT
        </b>
        <br />
        KOBAS Constructions

        <br />
        <br />

        <b>Vision Statement</b>
        <br />

KOBAS is a large Canadian-based construction company that operates in several countries around the globe. The company would like to centralize its governing process to monitor and direct KOBAS’ global activities. The monitoring processshould coverproject’s critical routes, project’s implementation progress, risks prediction, ongoing expenses, human resource activities, internal/external regulations and profit/loss accumulations. The envisioned solution should help decision makers in takingcritical decisions in a timely manner and enable executives to visualise opportunities using the latest predictive analysis techniques. 
	<br /><br />

<b> Problem Description </b>
        <br />

At present, KOBAS’ sites work in isolation mode. Each site has developed its own procedures and standards to manage and monitor operations.High-level reports are sent to the head office in Canada for consolidation, monitoring and controlling. The governance teamis facing challenges in merging these reports in a comprehensive fashion for executive use. This is preventing KOBAS from having a solid control over cash flows and remote project’s developments. Having a proper governing system would eliminate any fraud activity that can negatively affect company’s reputation, profits and future developments.
        <br /><br />

<b> Mission Statement </b>
        <br />
The CEO of the company has appointed an IT team to develop an automated governance application that equips managers with right tools to monitor major activities within the organization as well as to allow them to track the progress of ongoing construction projects. The visionwill be implemented in various phases where each phase would take care of a specific problem area. The outcome of all these phases should gradually frame towards the absolute vision of this project.
