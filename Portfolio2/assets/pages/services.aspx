I can work in variety of ways to enhance teaching and learning. The simple, web-based wiki platform makes group activities and course management easy and efficient. Wikispaces is notably different from a course management system because of it's ability for students to contribute multimedia content and to collaborate on assignments. Wikis simplify the process of publishing to a secure course website and they make peer-to-peer learning possible.

<br>Faculty can use Wikispaces to:<br>

<br>• Function as a course management system - with syllabus, reading list, and course materials
<br>• Promote and facilitate group projects or papers
<br>• Facilitate close reading and analysis
<br>• Allow for manual translation of text, video, or audio files
<br>• Build a repository of resources for the course
<br>• Conduct peer reviews of student papers
<br>• Create student project portfolios with images, videos, and text
