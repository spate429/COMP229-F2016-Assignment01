    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I’m an undergraduate and creative leader with a wide knowledge for programming languages. I’ve managed to carry out tasks with minimal resources and maximum result. I’ve built and managed many projects during the college period in Centennial College.</p>
    <p> Currently, I’m in third semester of software engineering technician program in Centennial college, Canada. During this period, I’ve managed to gain fair amount of knowledge of programming, database, web development and project management. Writing codes and creating websites has become passion for me and I am slowly but gradually working my way to the top.
